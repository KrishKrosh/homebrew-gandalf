# Audio Files for Homebrew Gandalf

The application looks for the following audio file:

- `door-open.mp3` - Sound effect played when the doors open

## Adding Your Own Sound

Replace this file with an actual MP3 sound file for the door opening effect. You can find free sound effects at:

- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/door/)
- [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/?s=door+open)

## File Missing Error Handling

If no audio file is found, the application will handle this gracefully and continue functioning without sound effects.
