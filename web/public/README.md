## Sound Files
You need to add a sound file for the door opening effect at:
`/sounds/door-open.mp3`

You can get free sound effects from:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)

Look for "door opening" or "door unlock" sound effects.

## Image Files
The application uses SVG images for the interface:
- `/images/coffee-cup.svg` - Logo/icon
- `/images/door-control.svg` - Door control button
